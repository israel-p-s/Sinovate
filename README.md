##Update to DIN Setup Script

Modified script from https://sinovate.io/downloads/sin_install_vps_noroot.sh

I had some problems for update my VPS to the new version.

The problem may be caused because the script install folders, daemon, etc in the $HOME and the new daemon works in the /root.

##What to do for update my node to DIN?
